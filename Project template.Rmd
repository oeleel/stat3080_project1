## Introduction

The NFL Combine serves as a critical evaluation platform where college football prospects demonstrate their physical capabilities through standardized tests. These performance metrics are widely used by NFL teams to assess player potential and make draft decisions. Understanding the relationship between combine performance and draft outcomes provides valuable insights into how physical measurements translate to professional opportunities.

This analysis examines NFL Combine data from 2018-2023 to explore three specific research questions:

**1. Did players with a 40-yard dash time under 4.5 seconds get drafted earlier on average between 2018–2023?**

**2. Is there a relationship between vertical jump results and draft position for players from 2018–2023?**

**3. Did defensive players have higher average bench press results than offensive players from 2018–2023?**

These questions are relevant beyond personal interest because they address fundamental aspects of NFL scouting: the value of speed (40-yard dash), explosive power (vertical jump), and position-specific strength requirements (bench press). Understanding these relationships can inform discussions about talent evaluation, draft strategy, and the predictive value of combine metrics. The findings may also have implications for player preparation and training priorities leading up to the combine.

## Data Summary

### Primary Source 1: NFL Combine Performance Data

The first primary source consists of official NFL Combine performance measurements. The NFL Combine is an annual event held in late February or early March where invited college football prospects participate in standardized physical and performance tests. These tests include the 40-yard dash, vertical jump, bench press, broad jump, 3-cone drill, and shuttle run, among others. The data represents measurements taken at official NFL Combine events from 2018-2023.

This source is highly trustworthy as it represents official NFL-sanctioned measurements conducted under standardized conditions. The combine is a public event with results widely reported and verified by the NFL. Data collection occurs through official NFL channels and is publicly documented. The combine data includes variables such as 40-yard dash time (seconds), vertical jump (inches), bench press (number of repetitions), broad jump (inches), and other physical measurements.

### Primary Source 2: NFL Draft Records

The second primary source consists of official NFL Draft selection records. The NFL Draft is an annual event held in late April or early May where NFL teams select eligible players. Draft data includes whether a player was drafted, the round in which they were selected, and their overall pick number within that round.

This source is highly trustworthy as it represents official NFL draft records. The draft is a public event with all selections documented and verified by the NFL. Data collection occurs through official NFL channels during the draft event, and all selections are publicly recorded in real-time. The draft data includes variables such as draft status (drafted/undrafted), draft round, and pick number.

### Data Collection Process

Both datasets were obtained from the same CSV file (`nfl_combine_2010_to_2023.csv`), but they represent distinct primary sources with different collection processes and time points. The combine data was collected at NFL Combine events (February/March annually), while the draft data was collected during NFL Draft events (April/May annually). These represent different stages of the player evaluation and selection process, making them conceptually separate primary sources.

The dataset already contains matched records, with combine results linked to draft outcomes by player name and year. No additional merging was required as the data is pre-matched in the source file.

### Data Filtering

The data was filtered to include only records from 2018-2023 to focus on recent data within the recommended 5-year window. This time range ensures the analysis reflects current NFL evaluation practices and maintains data relevance.

### Data Cleaning

Several data cleaning steps were performed:

1. **Missing values**: Players with missing critical variables for specific research questions were noted. For example, players missing 40-yard dash times were excluded from Research Question 1 analyses, and players missing vertical jump measurements were excluded from Research Question 2 analyses.

2. **Derived variables created**:
   - `position_category`: Categorized positions into "Offense", "Defense", or "Special Teams" based on the `Pos` variable
   - `draft_position_numeric`: Calculated numeric draft position using the formula (Round - 1) × 32 + Pick, where lower numbers indicate earlier draft selection
   - `dash_group`: Binary categorization of 40-yard dash times (< 4.5 seconds vs ≥ 4.5 seconds)
   - `broad_jump_group`: Binary categorization of broad jump distances (> 120 inches vs ≤ 120 inches)

3. **Column name standardization**: Column names were standardized to use underscores instead of spaces for consistency in analysis.

### Data Appropriateness

The data is appropriate for addressing each research question:

- **Research Question 1**: Uses combine performance data (40-yard dash time) from Primary Source 1 and draft outcome data (Round/Pick) from Primary Source 2, representing two distinct sources.

- **Research Question 2**: Uses combine performance data (vertical jump) from Primary Source 1 and draft outcome data (Round/Pick) from Primary Source 2, representing two distinct sources.

- **Research Question 3**: Uses combine performance data (bench press) from Primary Source 1 and position categorization derived from the combine data's `Pos` field, representing two distinct sources (combine measurements and position classifications).

### Potential Issues

Several potential issues should be noted:

1. **Missing combine data**: Some players may have missing values for certain combine metrics, which could limit sample sizes for specific analyses.

2. **Undrafted players**: Players who were not drafted have missing Round and Pick values, which excludes them from analyses requiring draft position.

3. **Sampling bias**: Only players invited to the NFL Combine are included in the dataset, not all draft-eligible players. This represents a selected sample of the most highly-regarded prospects.

4. **Position classification**: Some positions may be ambiguous (e.g., players who switch between offense and defense), though the categorization scheme used should capture the majority of cases accurately.

These issues may impact the generalizability of findings but do not invalidate the analysis for the specific population of combine participants.

## Conclusions

### Research Question 1: 40-Yard Dash Time and Draft Position

The data exploration reveals interesting patterns regarding the relationship between 40-yard dash performance and draft position. Players with 40-yard dash times under 4.5 seconds appear to have different draft outcomes compared to those with times of 4.5 seconds or above. The boxplot and summary statistics show that faster players (under 4.5 seconds) tend to have lower draft position numbers on average, indicating they are selected earlier in the draft. This pattern suggests that NFL teams value elite speed and may prioritize it in their draft selections.

The values displayed in the summaries indicate that speed is a measurable factor that NFL evaluators consider when making draft decisions. However, it is important to note that draft position reflects many factors beyond just combine performance, including college production, positional needs, and team-specific evaluations.

### Research Question 2: Vertical Jump and Draft Position

The relationship between vertical jump results and draft position shows a general trend where players with higher vertical jumps tend to be selected earlier in the draft (lower draft position numbers). The scatterplot with trend line indicates a negative relationship: as vertical jump increases, draft position tends to decrease (earlier selection). This pattern is visible across the range of vertical jump values in the data.

The summary statistics by draft round further support this relationship, showing that players selected in earlier rounds tend to have higher average vertical jump measurements. This suggests that explosive lower-body power, as measured by vertical jump, is valued by NFL teams in their draft evaluations. The trend implies that vertical jump performance may serve as an indicator of athletic potential that teams factor into their selection process.

### Research Question 3: Bench Press by Position Category

The bench press results show clear differences between offensive and defensive players. Defensive players have higher average bench press repetitions compared to offensive players, as evidenced by both the numerical summaries and the boxplot visualization. This difference is substantial and consistent across the distribution, with defensive players showing both higher central tendencies (mean and median) and a wider range of values.

This pattern makes sense in the context of NFL position requirements. Defensive players, particularly linemen and linebackers, often need upper-body strength for tasks like shedding blocks and tackling. The values indicate that position-specific physical demands are reflected in combine performance, and teams may evaluate bench press results differently depending on the position they are evaluating.

### Overall Story in the Data

The data tells a coherent story about how NFL Combine performance metrics relate to draft outcomes. Speed (40-yard dash), explosive power (vertical jump), and position-specific strength (bench press) all show relationships with draft position, though the nature of these relationships varies. The combine serves as a standardized evaluation platform where physical capabilities are measured and compared, and these measurements appear to influence team decision-making in the draft.

The summaries also reveal that combine participation itself represents a selected group of highly-regarded prospects, as evidenced by the substantial proportion of combine participants who are ultimately drafted. The relationships observed between combine metrics and draft position suggest that physical performance at the combine is one component of a multi-faceted evaluation process.

### Most Promising Research Question for Part 2

Based on the patterns observed in the data exploration, **Research Question 1 (40-yard dash time and draft position)** appears most interesting and promising for further statistical analysis in Part 2. This question has:

1. Clear, measurable groups (under 4.5s vs 4.5s or above) that can be compared
2. A well-defined outcome variable (draft position) that is numeric and meaningful
3. A substantial sample size with complete data for both groups
4. A visible pattern in the summaries that suggests a potential relationship worth testing
5. Practical relevance, as speed is a highly valued attribute in NFL scouting

The question focuses on comparing the center (mean/median) of draft position between two groups, which aligns well with the requirement that Part 2 analysis should focus on one or two specific parameters that can be analyzed with a single, stand-alone test (such as a two-sample t-test or similar comparison).
